## The problem

Most data analyst, data science, and coding courses miss a critical practical step. They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean, and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional.

The bootcamps we have seen online and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favour. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job.

## NumPy
NumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations.

## Why learn it?
A large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. In addition, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level.
